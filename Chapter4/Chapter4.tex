\section{Experiments}
\label{sec: Experiments}

\subsection{Initial Modelling}
In order to speed up initial training and testing for each machine learning algorithm, a multitude of subsets of the original combined data were created using sklearn's train\_test\_split to create a stratified split resulting in reduced data sets. Varying levels of data splits were created, including a 50\%, 60\% and 80\% data split from the original ~12 million rows of data as seen in Table \ref{tab:split_data}. 


\subsection{Parameter Tuning}
Due to the limitations in hardware and training time, the majority of models were optimised on a trial and error methodology to find the optimal parameters, with some instances where GridSearchCV and RandomisedSearchCV was used. We did not use 10-fold Stratified Cross Validation during initial experiments, this was justified under the pretence that the best found parameters would undergo cross validation training afterwards.
