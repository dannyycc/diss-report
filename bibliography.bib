abstract = {We introduce the key reinstallation attack. This attack abuses design or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an already-in-use key. This resets the key's associated parameters such as transmit nonces and receive replay counters. Several types of cryptographic Wi-Fi handshakes are affected by the attack. All protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake to generate a fresh session key. So far, this 14-year-old handshake has remained free from attacks, and is even proven secure. However, we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to a key reinstallation attack. Here, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already-in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying handshake messages. When reinstalling the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (nonce) and receive packet number (replay counter) are reset to their initial value. Our key reinstallation attack also breaks the PeerKey, group key, and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact depends on the handshake being attacked, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP an adversary can replay and decrypt (but not forge) packets. This makes it possible to hijack TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPA-TKIP and GCMP the impact is catastrophic: packets can be replayed, decrypted, and forged. Because GCMP uses the same authentication key in both communication directions, it is especially affected. Finally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks. Notably, our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android 6.0: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.},

In the last decade of years, wireless attacks are increasing day by day and it is now a very big problem for modern wireless communication systems. In this paper, the author's used the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID3). There are two versions of this dataset, one is over 200 million tuples of full data and one is 1.8 million tuples of reduced data. As our dataset has millions of tuples and over 100 columns, it is easy to become overwhelmed because of its size. The authors used the reduced version and predicted if an attack was one of four types using the k-nearest-neighbors classifier. All of the attack types we used had a distribution that highly favored the non-attack class. Our best results were for the attack ``arp'' type where we attained the best accuracy with recall. The author's primary goal of the paper was to attain the highest accuracy possible when creating a model that is capable of classifying the 4 attack types and detecting and classifying wireless attacks using Machine Learning models on the AWID3 dataset. One of the goals that supported this main objective was determining a way to avoid the curse of dimensionality.",

implemented to detect KRACK attack by passively monitoring multiple wireless channels. In particular, we perform deep packet inspection
and develop a grouping algorithm to group Wi-Fi handshake packets to identify the symptoms of the KRACK in specific stages of a

the authenticator i.e., access point or the COTS devices, our system just needs to be in the accessible range from clients and access
points. We use a publicly available dataset for performance analysis of kTRACKER. We employ gradient boosting-based supervised machine
learning models, and show that an accuracy around 93.39\% and a false positive rate of 5.08\% can be achieved using kTRACKER.},

ABSTRACT = {Aiming at the intrusion detection problem of the wireless sensor network (WSN), considering the combined characteristics of the wireless sensor network, we consider setting up a corresponding intrusion detection system on the edge side through edge computing. An intrusion detection system (IDS), as a proactive network security protection technology, provides an effective defense system for the WSN. In this paper, we propose a WSN intelligent intrusion detection model, through the introduction of the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN) in machine learning and the introduction of the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) in evolutionary calculation, to form an edge intelligence framework that specifically performs the intrusion detection when the WSN encounters a DoS attack. In order to enhance the accuracy of the model, we use a parallel strategy to enhance the communication between the populations and use the L&eacute;vy flight strategy to adjust the optimization. The proposed PL-AOA algorithm performs well in the benchmark function test and effectively guarantees the improvement of the kNN classifier. We use Matlab2018b to conduct simulation experiments based on the WSN-DS data set and our model achieves 99\% ACC, with a nearly 10\% improvement compared with the original kNN when performing DoS intrusion detection. The experimental results show that the proposed intrusion detection model has good effects and practical application significance.},

ABSTRACT = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has advanced digital technology and the fastest interconnection, which creates opportunities to substantially grow industrial businesses today. Although IIoT provides promising opportunities for growth, the massive sensor IoT data collected are easily attacked by cyber criminals. Hence, IIoT requires different high security levels to protect the network. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the crucial security solutions, which aims to detect the network \& abnormal behavior and monitor safe network traffic to avoid attacks. In particular, the effectiveness of the Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS approach to building a secure IDS application is attracting the security research community in both the general cyber network and the specific IIoT network. However, most available IIoT datasets contain multiclass output data with imbalanced distributions. This is the main reason for the reduction in the detection accuracy of attacks of the ML-based IDS model. This research proposes an IDS for IIoT imbalanced datasets by applying the eXtremely Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to overcome this issue. Two modern IIoT imbalanced datasets were used to assess our proposed method \& effectiveness and robustness, X-IIoTDS and TON_IoT. The XGBoost model achieved excellent attack detection with F1 scores of 99.9\% and 99.87\% on the two datasets. This result demonstrated that the proposed approach improved the detection attack performance in imbalanced multiclass IIoT datasets and was superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

ABSTRACT = {The growth of wireless networks has been remarkable in the last few years. One of the main reasons for this growth is the massive use of portable and stand-alone devices with wireless network connectivity. These devices have become essential on the daily basis in consumer electronics. As the dependency on wireless networks has increased, the attacks against them over time have increased as well. To detect these attacks, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with high accuracy and low detection time is needed. In this work, we propose a machine learning (ML) based wireless network intrusion detection system (WNIDS) for Wi-Fi networks to efficiently detect attacks against them. The proposed WNIDS consists of two stages that work together in a sequence. An ML model is developed for each stage to classify the network records into normal or one of the specific attack classes. We train and validate the ML model for WNIDS using the publicly available Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID). Several feature selection techniques have been considered to identify the best features set for the WNIDS. Our two-stage WNIDS achieves an accuracy of 99.42\% for multi-class classification with a reduced set of features. A module for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is implemented as well to understand the influence of features on each type of network traffic records.},

ABSTRACT = {Intrusion detection in wireless and, more specifically, Wi-Fi networks is lately increasingly under the spotlight of the research community. However, the literature currently lacks a comprehensive assessment of the potential to detect application layer attacks based on both 802.11 and non-802.11 network protocol features. The investigation of this capacity is of paramount importance since Wi-Fi domains are often used as a stepping stone by threat actors for unleashing an ample variety of application layer assaults. In this setting, by exploiting the contemporary AWID3 benchmark dataset along with both shallow and deep learning machine learning techniques, this work attempts to provide concrete answers to a dyad of principal matters. First, what is the competence of 802.11-specific and non-802.11 features when used separately and in tandem in detecting application layer attacks, say, website spoofing? Second, which network protocol features are the most informative to the machine learning model for detecting application layer attacks? Without relying on any optimization or dimensionality reduction technique, our experiments, indicatively exploiting an engineered feature, demonstrate a detection performance up to 96.7\% in terms of the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.},

abstract={Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) successfully drew attention to the deployment of 5th Generation (5G) wireless communication systems, and it is now considered a significant technology in 5G communications. The primary enhancement in 5G is the speed, which may be 100 times faster than 4G. Due to the rising number of internal or external attacks on the Network, wireless intrusion detection systems are a vital aspect of any system connected to the Internet, and 5G will demand considerable improvements in data rate and security. In this paper, we have built a simulator for NOMA and applied a dropping attack to extract a dataset from the simulation model. The accuracy for detecting dropping attacks using the extracted data after applying ML algorithms was 95.7{\%} for LR. Furthermore, this work suggests a methodology for wireless cyberattack detection in 5G networks based on applying several ML and DL techniques such as Decision Trees, KNN, Multi-class Decision Jungle, Multi-class Decision Forest, and Multi-class Neural Network. The proposed work is implemented and tested using a comprehensive Wi-Fi network benchmark dataset. The conducted experiments resulted in an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 99{\%} for the KNN algorithm and 93{\%} for DF and Neural Network.},

paradigm that has gained significant traction from many researchers to address the
requirement of current data centers. Although central control is the major advantage of SDN,
it is also a single point of failure if it is made unreachable by a Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attack. Despite the large number of traditional detection solutions that
exist currently, DDoS attacks continue to grow in frequency, volume, and severity. This
paper brings an analysis of the problem and suggests the implementation of four machine
learning algorithms (SVM, MLP, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) with the purpose of
classifying DDoS attacks in an SDN simulated environment (Mininet 2.2.2). With this goal,
the DDoS attacks were simulated using the Scapy tool with a list of valid IPs, acquiring, as
a result, the best accuracy with the Random Forest algorithm and the best processing time
with the Decision Tree algorithm. Moreover, it is shown the most important features to
classify DDoS attacks and some drawbacks in the implementation of a classifier to detect the
three kinds of DDoS attacks discussed in this paper (controller attack, flow-table attack,
and bandwidth attack).},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a complete system for monitoring and detecting attacks and anomalies in 5G wireless local area networks. Regrettably, the development of most open source systems has been stopped, making them unable to detect emerging forms of threats. The system provides a modular framework to create and add new detection rules as new attacks emerge. The system is based on packet analysis modules and rules and incorporates machine learning models to enhance its efficiency. The use of rule-based detection establishes a strong basis for the identification of recognized threats, whereas the additional implementation of machine learning models enables the detection of new and emerging attacks at an early stage. Therefore, the ultimate aim is to create a tool that constantly evolves by integrating novel attack detection techniques. The efficiency of the system is proven experimentally with accuracy levels up to 98.57\% and precision as well as recall scores as high as 92\%.},

 abstract = {With the advent of new IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6) devices, enabling security is a priority. Since previous versions were found to have security vulnerabilities, the WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) was introduced to fix the most common security flaws. Although WPA3 is an improvement over its predecessor in terms of security, recently, it was found that WPA3 has a few security vulnerabilities as well. In this paper, we have mentioned the previously known vulnerabilities in WPA3 and WPA2. In addition, we have created our dataset based on WPA3 attacks. We have proposed a two-stage solution for detecting an intrusion in the network. The two-stage approach will help ease the computational processing burden of an AP and WLAN Controller. First, Access Point (AP) will perform a lightweight, simple operation for some duration (say 500ms) at a particular time interval. Upon discovering any abnormality in the flow of traffic, an ML-based solution at the controller will detect the type of attack. Our approach is to utilize resources on AP and the back-end controller with a certain optimization level. We have achieved over 99\% accuracy in attack detection using a Machine Learning (ML) based solution. We have also publicly provided our code and dataset for the open-source research community so that it can contribute to future research work.},

  abstract = 	 {In imbalanced multi-class classification problems, the misclassification rate as an error measure may not be a relevant choice. Several methods have been developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the mere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information, etc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we propose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to be optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show that using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite interesting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,  especially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then consists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method — namely AdaBoost.MM — to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing  the empirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the properties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results illustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach compared to other methods.}
