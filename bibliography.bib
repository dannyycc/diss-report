abstract = {We introduce the key reinstallation attack. This attack abuses design or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an already-in-use key. This resets the key's associated parameters such as transmit nonces and receive replay counters. Several types of cryptographic Wi-Fi handshakes are affected by the attack. All protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake to generate a fresh session key. So far, this 14-year-old handshake has remained free from attacks, and is even proven secure. However, we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to a key reinstallation attack. Here, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already-in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying handshake messages. When reinstalling the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (nonce) and receive packet number (replay counter) are reset to their initial value. Our key reinstallation attack also breaks the PeerKey, group key, and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact depends on the handshake being attacked, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP an adversary can replay and decrypt (but not forge) packets. This makes it possible to hijack TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPA-TKIP and GCMP the impact is catastrophic: packets can be replayed, decrypted, and forged. Because GCMP uses the same authentication key in both communication directions, it is especially affected. Finally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks. Notably, our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android 6.0: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.},

abstract="A wireless attack is a malicious action against wireless systems and wireless networks. In the last decade of years, wireless attacks are increasing day by day and it is now a very big problem for modern wireless communication systems. In this paper, the author's used the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID3). There are two versions of this dataset, one is over 200 million tuples of full data and one is 1.8 million tuples of reduced data. As our dataset has millions of tuples and over 100 columns, it is easy to become overwhelmed because of its size. The authors used the reduced version and predicted if an attack was one of four types using the k-nearest-neighbors classifier. All of the attack types we used had a distribution that highly favored the non-attack class. Our best results were for the attack ``arp'' type where we attained the best accuracy with recall. The author's primary goal of the paper was to attain the highest accuracy possible when creating a model that is capable of classifying the 4 attack types and detecting and classifying wireless attacks using Machine Learning models on the AWID3 dataset. One of the goals that supported this main objective was determining a way to avoid the curse of dimensionality.",

ABSTRACT = {Intrusion detection in wireless and, more specifically, Wi-Fi networks is lately increasingly under the spotlight of the research community. However, the literature currently lacks a comprehensive assessment of the potential to detect application layer attacks based on both 802.11 and non-802.11 network protocol features. The investigation of this capacity is of paramount importance since Wi-Fi domains are often used as a stepping stone by threat actors for unleashing an ample variety of application layer assaults. In this setting, by exploiting the contemporary AWID3 benchmark dataset along with both shallow and deep learning machine learning techniques, this work attempts to provide concrete answers to a dyad of principal matters. First, what is the competence of 802.11-specific and non-802.11 features when used separately and in tandem in detecting application layer attacks, say, website spoofing? Second, which network protocol features are the most informative to the machine learning model for detecting application layer attacks? Without relying on any optimization or dimensionality reduction technique, our experiments, indicatively exploiting an engineered feature, demonstrate a detection performance up to 96.7\% in terms of the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.},

abstract={Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) successfully drew attention to the deployment of 5th Generation (5G) wireless communication systems, and it is now considered a significant technology in 5G communications. The primary enhancement in 5G is the speed, which may be 100 times faster than 4G. Due to the rising number of internal or external attacks on the Network, wireless intrusion detection systems are a vital aspect of any system connected to the Internet, and 5G will demand considerable improvements in data rate and security. In this paper, we have built a simulator for NOMA and applied a dropping attack to extract a dataset from the simulation model. The accuracy for detecting dropping attacks using the extracted data after applying ML algorithms was 95.7{\%} for LR. Furthermore, this work suggests a methodology for wireless cyberattack detection in 5G networks based on applying several ML and DL techniques such as Decision Trees, KNN, Multi-class Decision Jungle, Multi-class Decision Forest, and Multi-class Neural Network. The proposed work is implemented and tested using a comprehensive Wi-Fi network benchmark dataset. The conducted experiments resulted in an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 99{\%} for the KNN algorithm and 93{\%} for DF and Neural Network.},

Specifically, we firstly summarize fundamental problems of network security and attack detection and introduce several successful related applications using deep learning structure. On the basis of categorization on deep learning methods, we pay special attention to attack detection methods built on different kinds of architectures, such as autoencoders, generative adversarial network, recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network. Afterwards, we present some benchmark datasets with descriptions and compare the performance of representing approaches to show the current working state of attack detection methods with deep learning structures.

Several methods have been developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the mere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information, etc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we propose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to be optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show that using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite interesting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,  especially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then consists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method — namely AdaBoost.MM — to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing  the empirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the properties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results illustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach compared to other methods.}
