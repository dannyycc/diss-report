\section{Analysis Of Results}
 \label{sec: Analysis Of Results}

% TODO Summarise the Results of each model here and talk about the best model here. 

In this section, the performance of the machine learning models on the test set is analysed and discussed. The models are evaluated using the metrics discussed previously, such as F1-Score, Area Under Curve (AUC), Precision, Recall and Accuracy. The best-performing models and algorithms are identified and interpreted. Finally, limitations and challenges faced in the analysis are discussed and addressed and areas of improvement for future work are suggested.

% \subsection{Performance on Test Set}

% Now begin the analysis of each model

\subsection{Comparison of Models}

% TODO Talk about the best models from each algorithm and then compare the results, features etc and conclude on one or more models that are the best for this classification problem.

\subsection{Model Interpretation}

% Discuss any insights gained from the analysis of the machine learning models, including which features were important for the models' decision-making process and how these features impacted the performance of the models.

\subsection{Limitations}

% Acknowledge any limitations of your analysis and potential sources of error. Explain how these limitations could impact the generalizability of your findings.

\subsection{Future Work}

% Suggest potential areas for future work that could build on your analysis and improve the performance of machine learning models in the specific problem you addressed and in the field more broadly.
